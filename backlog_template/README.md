# LLM Task Management Instructions

---

## template: backlog_readme

This directory (`@backlog/`) contains individual task files for your project. Each taskâ€™s status is encoded in its filename.

**Naming Convention:**
`[task-id]-[short-description]--[status].md`

**Task Statuses:**

- **`--todo` (or no suffix):** The task is identified and ready to be started. This is the default state if no status suffix is present.
  - _LLM Action:_ Identify these as the next tasks to work on.
- **`--in-progress`:** The LLM is currently working on this task.
  - _LLM Action:_ Rename a `--todo` task to `--in-progress` when beginning work on it.
- **`--blocked`:** The task cannot proceed because it's waiting for external input (e.g., user clarification, a dependency to be resolved).
  - _LLM Action:_ Rename an `--in-progress` task to `--blocked` if progress is halted.
- **`--review` / `--awaiting-review`:** The LLM has completed its work, but human review or approval is required.
  - _LLM Action:_ Rename an `--in-progress` task to `--review` when work is complete and ready for human validation.
- **`--done` / `--completed`:** The task is fully finished and verified.
  - _LLM Action:_ Rename an `--in-progress` or `--review` task to `--done` once all criteria are met and verified.
- **`--skipped` / `--cancelled`:** The task has been explicitly decided not to be implemented, or it's no longer relevant.
  - _LLM Action:_ Rename any task to `--skipped` or `--cancelled` if instructed by the user or if it becomes obsolete.

**LLM Workflow for Task Selection:**

1. Use `list_directory` or `glob` on `@backlog/` to get an overview of all task files.
2. Prioritize files that do _not_ have `--done`, `--skipped`, or `--cancelled` suffixes.
3. Prefer tasks with `--todo` (or no suffix) or `--in-progress` status.
4. When starting a new task, rename its file to include `--in-progress`.
5. Upon completion of a task, rename its file to include `--done`.

## Progress Tracking

Below is a template for tracking tasks in this directory. Copy, paste, and update this table as you add or complete tasks.

| File                                 | Description   | Status      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| 01-short-description--todo.md        | Brief summary | todo        |
| 02-short-description--in-progress.md | Brief summary | in-progress |
| 03-short-description--blocked.md     | Brief summary | blocked     |
| 04-short-description--review.md      | Brief summary | review      |
| 05-short-description--done.md        | Brief summary | done        |

## Next Steps for LLM

1. Review the tasks in `@backlog/` using `list_directory` or `glob`.
2. Identify the next `--todo` task (or a task with no status suffix).
3. Rename the task file to `[task-id]-[short-description]--in-progress.md` before starting work.
4. Follow the instructions within the task file.
5. Upon successful completion and verification, rename the task file to `[task-id]-[short-description]--done.md`.
6. If a task becomes blocked, rename it to `[task-id]-[short-description]--blocked.md` and inform the user.
